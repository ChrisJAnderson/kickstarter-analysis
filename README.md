# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis and visualization of a selection of kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017. It focuses on kickstarters for the "theater" category and "play" subcategory and groups them by outcome in the categories of "successful", "failed", and "canceled". This project visualizes trends in the frequency of each outcome by a kickstarter's launch date and also by the goal of the kickstarter. 
Visualization of the data takes the form of two line charts.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide readable and useable data to a client hoping to launch a kickstarter for a theater production by breaking down the data from eight years of kickstarters into charts that can be used to gain insight into the probability of a kickstarter's success based on its goal and its launch date. 
These insights set our client up for success by giving them the ability to make data-driven decisions about the best time to launch and the best goal to set for the highest probability of a successful kickstarter.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater Outcomes Vs Launch](https://github.com/ChrisJAnderson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
The graph of Analysis Based on Launch date takes the total amount of kickstarters in the theater parent category and displays the amount of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters for each month. The graph is not filtered by year- it includes the entirety of theater kickstarters from 2009 to 2017. With the exception of December, theater kickstarters succeed at a higher rate than they fail, with the highest number of successful kickstarters launching in May. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes Vs Goals](https://github.com/ChrisJAnderson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
The graph of Analysis Based on Goals shows a mostly downwards trend in kickstarters in the play subcatergory as goals grow higher, with notable exceptions of kickstarters with goals between 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999, where the rate of success spikes to 67% for both data points up from 27%. There is also a slight increase immediately before this, going from 20% success at 25000 to 29999 to 27% at 30000 to 39999, but overall kickstarters with goals below 25000 are more successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The largest challenge was formatting the pivot table that was used to make the Outcomes Based on Goals graph. It required attention to the formatting of percentages failed/successful/canceled in order to make them display in a readable fashion in the graph, without excess zeroes and to the sorting of the row labels that form the x axis so that they displayed in the correct order, without "Less than 1000" displaying after "50000 or more". Another challenge I faced was writing the countifs for deliverable 2- initially my data was skewed by not accounting for the lower bounds of a range, and my formulas took the values of everything under the upper bound of a bracket
## Results
The graph of Outcomes Based on Launch Date shows that there is the highest chance of success for a theater kickstarter that launches in May, with 111 successful kickstarters. June is the next highest with 100 successful theater kickstarters. May also has the most favorable difference of successful to failed theater kickstarters, with more than twice as many successful kickstarters as failed kickstarters. December is the least favorable month to launch a theater kickstarter, with only 37 successful kickstarters versus 35 failed kickstarters- practically a fifty percent chance of success based on launch date.

The graph of Outcomes Based on Goals shows that for the most part kickstarters for plays with lower goals are more successful, although success rates spike to 67% success between the values 35000 and 40000. Since there is otherwise a downwards trend in the data, it's possible this is an error based around the fact that the values of goals are not standardized to one currency. We can also see that even the most successful bracket of kickstarters, with goals of less than 1000, have only a 76% success rate.

There are several limitations to this dataset. The first is that the values used in Outcomes Based on Goals are not standardized against any one currency or filtered by currency. The graphs treat the amount of each goal as equivalent, when that isn't necessarily the case. The second is that the most recent year included in this dataset is 2017, and analyzes an economy that hasn't yet been affected by a global pandemic. Meeting a kickstarter goal today may be more difficult (or less difficult) than meeting that goal in 2009 or 2017, but there is no way of knowing from the data. A final limitation is that Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals are filtered on different parameters (Theater Outcomes uses the theater parent category and Outcomes Based on Goals uses a subcategory of plays). I would like to see these filtered based on the same criteria.

My recommendations for additional graphs include graphs which distinguish successful kickstarters over time by year, similar to the existing Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, to analyze a growing or shrinking interest in theater kickstarters over time. The existing Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date could also be filtered to display data for a particular year.
I would also like to modify the graph of Outcomes Based on Goals to use different filtering- I would like to be able to see the outcomes in different countries to get more precise data and potentially address the issue of different currencies not being properly converted within the dataset.
